/*TODO: When a user visits /login.jsp, they should see a form for logging in. This form should have a 'username' and 'password' field.*/



/*TODO: This form should submit a POST request to /login.jsp*/




/*TODO: Inside of login.jsp write some code to check the submitted values. If the username submitted is "admin", and the password is "password", redirect the user to the profile page; otherwise, redirect back to the login form.*/
